# sql2xls - SQL to Excel Export Tool

Imagine being able to export the results of a T-SQL query straight into an Excel file. Imagine being able to export the results of an unlimited number of scripts at one time.

Well now you can with my free tool sql2xls. The first beta v0.0.1 is available for download from this link. You can export the results of one or more scripts into an Excel file per instance or database.

Currently only a .NET Framework 4.7.2 executable exists. In the near future, there will be versions for .NET Core as well.

## Requirements

- 7-Zip to unpack the compressed file
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 to run the executable

## Configuration

- Edit the connection.json file to set up a connection to a SQL Server instance.
- Edit the config.json file to change the path of the output folder.

## Stored procedures

Add any stored procedures you want to install, to the procs folder. Files must have a .sql extension.

## Ad hoc scripts

Add any scripts you want to execute, to the scripts folder. Files must have a .sql extension.

_Note: If you want to execute any of the stored procedures, you must add a file in the scripts folder which runs the stored procedure. Each stored procedure you need to run must be separated by the GO batch separator on its own line. Itâ€™s probably better to keep these in their own separate files though._

## Excel output

One file is created per database, including the master database.

## Dependencies

- JSON.NET (for parsing config files and SQL Server results)
- ClosedXML (for generating the Excel output)
- Costura.Fody (for generating a single assembly file)
